# DigipetCapstone

Digipet is a language review game intended to supplement a course in Spanish, French, or Mandarin.

Installation:
You're going to need to install cocoapods. To do this, open your terminal and type:

sudo gem install cocoapods

Clone the project. After this, you need to open the project folder and update the pods in the project:

cd DigipetCapstone

pod update

pod install

open xcode

Once you've done this, you should be able to run the project.

Some things you might want to work on:
- Updating the app to fit different screen sizes
- Adding lesson/game content
- Creating a login function
- Creating a way for teachers to customize content
- Debugging (always fun)
